If you wish to contribute feel free to do so! Just clone the repo, make your changes on your own repo and then open a pull request to pull it back to imperial-crystalline-recursion/abtestgen. Easy as that!

Just try to keep your code style consistent and if you're fixing a bug, see if you can write some tests to guard against any future regression. Those are the guidelines I'd like to loosely apply.
